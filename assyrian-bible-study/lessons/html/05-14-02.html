<p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Exodus 2:1-10</p>
<p><strong>Biblical Material:</strong> A Levi woman decides to save her new born son by hiding him in the reeds along the bank of the Nile River. Pharaoh’s daughter took notice of the basket and finds the child. She decides to adopt the child and names him Moses. The name Moses in Egyptian language may mean "Son", however, in Hebrew it means "drawn from water or saved from water".</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The name of Moses is a prophetic statement of things to come. We have already learned in Genesis that "water is a symbol of God’s wrath upon the world due to man’s sin. Moses is going to be the tool that God will use to save His chosen ones from His wrath.</p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Spiritual success is by trusting God alone and focusing on His strength.</p>
<p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Exodus 3</p>
<p><strong>Biblical Material:</strong> God has called Moses in to action. Moses has unsuccessfully tried two questions to reject this ministry. One, who am I? and two, who are you to make this a success? God has answered both of his questions but Moses is not done yet. The third question is what if no one believes? God answers Moses by again shifting the focus on Himself. He does three miracles and signs that demonstrate His powers.</p>
<p><strong>Faith Lesson:</strong> We must not focus on our enemy. God is almighty and able. We must focus our eyes on Jesus and trust His power.</p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To understand the meaning of "Sanctification".</p>
<p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Exodus 2:11-15</p>
<p><strong>Biblical Material:</strong> Moses is very emotionally involved with his Hebrew nation. Although he has grown up with Egyptians, He still considers the cause of Israelites. In His heat of passion for His people, he commits a murder and finds out that his safety is in jeopardy. His action to save his people using his own force ends up in 40 years of fugitive life in wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In this session we learn that begins the redemption of Israelites by first sanctifying Moses. He allows Moses to make a big mistake in life and spend 40 years in wilderness in complete submission to God. In these 40 years of desert life Moses learns to listen, and obey God rather than act in the hear of his own passion or will.</p>

## "The Sign of God"

### 6/25/02

**Objective:** God’s greatest miracle in our lives is our transformation to new "born again" creations.

**Scriptures:** Exodus 3:11-12

**Biblical Material:** An interesting conversation begins between God and Moses. Moses severely argues his incompetence to lead God’s mission and God replies in a miraculous ways to every excuse. God’s sign of guarantee to all Israelites is the fact that Moses and all Israelites will finally bow down to God and worship Him on the same Mountain.

**Conclusion:** God’s greatest miracle in our lives is His ability to transform our hearts to love and worship Him. He is a creator but He does not create robots of slaves. He transforms our hearts. He changes our way of thinking. He influences our value system and priorities. We bow to Him because we are awed by Him. This transformation is God’s miracle in each and every one of our lives.

## "Thorns"

### 6/4/02

**Objective:** To understand the meaning of "sin" and its consequences upon us.

**Scriptures:** Exodus 2:16 – Exodus 3:1-3

**Biblical Material:** Moses has lost all hopes of going back to his own country and people. He marries a gentile woman and begins his alien life in the desert. Forty years later Moses is called by the burning bush in the desert. Little did he know that this acquaintance would be his invitation to lead one of the most dramatic historic event- the Exodus.

**Conclusion:** In this chapter we learn that the burning bush is a symbolic picture that reveals God’s nature and purpose. The bush represents the nation of Israel. The fire upon the bush is the judgment of God. And the thorns on the bush represent the sin and the consequences of sin that have lead Israelites to its miserable life. The bush is not consumed in the fire, for God will not destroy Israel by His judgment. Instead, we will study later on in the New Testament, that God will pour all His judgment upon His Son, Jesus Christ, to bear our sins and Father’s wrath.

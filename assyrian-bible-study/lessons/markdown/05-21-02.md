## "Atonement"

### 5/21/02

**Objective:** To learn the meaning of the word "atonement".

**Scriptures:** Exodus 2:3, Leviticus 17:11, Genesis 6:16

**Bible Plot:** Moses’ mother shows tremendous amount of faith in saving her little child. By applying tar on a basket she makes an ark- like vessel to place Moses in the reed of Nile. The biblical word used for Moses’ basket is the same as for the "Ark" of Noah. Both vessels are protected by pitch or tar. The Hebrew word for tar is "Ka-phar" meaning to cover. The same word is also used to mean atonement or reconciliation.

**Conclusion:** Noah and Moses both enjoyed the safety of God by a protective covering that God made available around their box like arks. In both instances, the tar symbolizes God’s covering that brings about life and reconciliation to God. In English the word atonement is used to mean reconciliation to God. Atonement is a taken from the words "At" and "One". We enjoy atonement for our sins and reconciliation to God by the blood of Jesus that covered our sins.

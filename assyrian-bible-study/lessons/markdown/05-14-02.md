**Biblical Material:** A Levi woman decides to save her new born son by hiding him in the reeds along the bank of the Nile River. Pharaoh’s daughter took notice of the basket and finds the child. She decides to adopt the child and names him Moses. The name Moses in Egyptian language may mean "Son", however, in Hebrew it means "drawn from water or saved from water".

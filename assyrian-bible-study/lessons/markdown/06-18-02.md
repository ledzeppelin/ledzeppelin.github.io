## "Who Am I?"

### 6/18/02

**Objective:** One of the most important requirements for servants of God is the aware of our dependents to Him.

**Scriptures:** Exodus: 3:7-12

**Biblical Material:** God hears the plea of His chosen people Israel. The salvation of Israelites is now at hand. Moses is invited to become the mediator between God and Israel. But Moses questions himself and God.

**Faith Lesson:** Every believer that steps in to God’s mission needs to know his limitations and dependence to God. We must understand that it is by God that we are called. It is by God, that we are given the chance to serve. It is by God that we have the strength to proceed with the mission. And it is by God alone that we succeed. We are only tools to express God’s plan of love and salvation to the world.
